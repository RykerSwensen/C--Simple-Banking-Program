## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for creating  a  simple banking app in C++.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first C++ project:

- [VS Community IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [GitHub Online Repository](https://github.com/)

Once you have these resources installed on your device, open Visual Studio Community. 
Once you have the application opened, start a new  c++ console app.
Place the project where you will easily remember  how to access it.
Next, hover over to the solution explorer. The solution explorer
is essentially where you can view all the files and folder within the project. 
Identify the Source Files folder.  Right click on the source files folder  and click the add option
that pops up. Then click c++ file. Now you have a c++ file to start working in!
If you would like to rename the file, just hover over the new file, right click and rename.
